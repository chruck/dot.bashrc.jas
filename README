This is just my .bashrc .  I name it .bashrc.jas so it doesn't
immediately clobber whatever .bashrc is on whatever new system I am
on.  I usually rename an existing .bashrc to .bashrc.orig, then create
a symlink for .bashrc to this file.

Sourcing this file loads all environment variables in this file and
creates the files it creates.  At one time it also created the
afore-mentioned symlink.

Calling this file as a program, either by chmod'ing it +x or by
calling it with `bash', then giving it the argument `incr', will
increment the ${JAS_ROX} variable to today's date.  I use this to let
me know what version of this file is currently on the current system.
This will probably change, now that I'll be tracking it in `git'.
This also copies the file to all the various machines that I expect
this file to be updated on.  This probably needs to be refactored to
read a file with a list of machines.
